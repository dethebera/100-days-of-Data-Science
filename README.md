Now this there isn't a fixed ide that you can gets your hand dirty with. But the best two are - 
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) 
- [Vs Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

Keep in mind that here we are taking the more "Traditional" approach of learning Data Science with **Python**, if you feel like working with R, that is amazing go ahead and download [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com).

That's it for DaY 1! Prep yourselves we will be starting from tmr... by then I would suggest you all to go thru few tutorials and get familiar with the environment. Anaconda is a full data science package and unlike VS Code you dont have to install anything else. VS Code on the other hand takes very little efforts to setup and a little time to get used to, but once done it works like a charm and I use it as a one stop for all coding projects and building websites. Below is the link that should help you setup
"Extensions" for VS Code.
