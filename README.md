# Day 1 - Installing the Tools

Now this there isn't a fixed ide that you can gets your hand dirty with. But the best two are - 
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) 
- [Vs Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

Keep in mind that here we are taking the more "Traditional" approach of learning Data Science with **Python**, if you feel like working with R, that is amazing go ahead and download [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com).

Also... for windows users here is the [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKVRkB0fot0) to get you started with the installation.


That's it for DaY 1! Prep yourselves we will be starting from tmr... by then I would suggest you all to go thru few tutorials and get familiar with the environment. Anaconda is a full data science package and unlike VS Code you do not have to install anything else. VS Code on the other hand takes very little efforts to setup and a little time to get used to, but once done it works like a charm and I use it as a one stop for all coding projects and building websites. Below is the link that should help you setup
"Extensions" for VS Code.

[Vs Code Setup for Data Science.](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/data-science-tutorial)

<br>

# Day 2 to 10  - Programming for DS (Basic)

If you are already well versed in python. I would still suggest you to complete [this](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python) course which is free and will help you warmup for the journey ahead. 

Now, If you have no clue about python and how to get started well no worries, there are plenty of resources online and I'll  set you on the right path. Let's get started.

1. Python Basics - Start from 0 - [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2k9Jh3jDVU&list=PLWKjhJtqVAbkmRvnFmOd4KhDdlK1oIq23) - 2 Hours <br> 
 Now if none of these links help you and you still do not understand.... do not worry! We still got you covered. Here's this amazing video for everyone starting right from 0.


2. Python for Data Science - [LINK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHBE6Q9XlzI) - 12 Hours<br>
 Freecodecamp's one of the best free resources and here we leverage their amazing 12 hour video for absolute beginners to get started with their journey. 

3. Python Basics with Kaggle - [LINK](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python) - 4 Hours.<br>
This link is from Kaggle. If you know any other languages like C / C++ / Java then python should'nt be hard to get started with. The above link will take almost 4 hours to get complete even if you are a beginner in python. 

For the ones who have are well versed in python, I would suggest you take only python with Kaggle that should refresh everything.

<br>

### Schedule

Given that there is no fixed way that one might use the above links let's sort the schedule part for you. We have 8 days in total. (It was supposed to be 7 but we value your precious **sunday** 😉).


**For Beginners** (Using All 3 links)

So we have a lot to work with... yeah? Here...we are planning to utilize 2 hours from your precious 24 for python. 

|   Day/Days |      Hours                         |
| -----------| -----------                        |
|  2         |   2 hours (start form 0)           |
| 3 to 8     |   2 hours each day (freecodecamp)  |
| 9 to 10    |   2 hours each for Kaggle          |

<br>
<br>

# Day 11 to 21  - SQL for DataScience
Hi! Pretty sure you are now a "pythonista" now let's tackle this SQL. 
Unlike many other pathways out there, SQL is usually placed at the last to cover and being a student myself I am pretty sure if SQL is done in the last days.... Nobody would want to do it.
Why should we tackle it AND **Why 10 days for SQL?** and get it done with? 
- It's easy.
- It's Super easy
- It's a must if you want a to be a Data Scientist

Now SQL is very important when it comes to handling data and with analysis. Below are the links that you will surely help and set you on the path to master SQL

- [SQL from the start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXV3zeQKqGY) - 4 hours <br>
Beginners... This is right where you should start.
- [Querying and managing data](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql#sql-basics)<br>
This is Khan Academy's finest. There are practice tests... Go and ace it!
- [SQL Tutorial for Data Analysis](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/introduction-to-sql/)<br> **Note**: This is the most important of the lot, as we have just 100 Days, we need to know what a particular topic is and what it is used for in a certain area. Here, we are focusing on **SQL for Data Science**. This link has 3 subparts (basic, intermediate, advanced). Check the image below.
![pic](/sqltut.png)
<br>

### Schedule

We have the materials now and let's look over at the schedule.
The schedule is being provided for beginners the ones who are already feeling confident on the topics do not go easy on yourself. A little revision would not hurt. **100days** 🔥
<br>

|  Day/Days        |  Hours                                        |
| -----------      | ----------------                              |
| 11-12            | 2 hours each (Sql From start)                 |
| 13-18            | 2 hours each (SQL Tutorial for Data Analysis) |
| 19-20 (Optional) | Querying and managing data                    |

<br>
Now the last is optional if you are able to complete the rest in time. 

<br>
<br>

# Day 22 to 25  - Statistics for DataScience
Okay...Now you might be thinking what in the world is going ... SQL then Stats!.... **lemme tell you from my experience of two specializations and ton of courses.** "STATS IS GOD". You heard me right it's way important to understand the use of statistics in data science and why it is important. 

If you are getting started with stats for data science here is a great article to just read about the use of stats and the various approaches. [Link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/statistics-for-data-science/).

Now let's start with the videos that will surely help you get started ->
- [Stats-1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ua-CiDNNj30&list=PLWKjhJtqVAblQe2CCWqV4Zy3LY01Z8aF1&index=1&t=17043s) - 1 Hour<br>
This directly starts from 4th hour of the video which is 6 hours long as we only need to focus on the stats part. 
- [Stats-2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfo5le26IhY) - 7 Hours<br>
This amazing 7 hour course is taught by PHD from Stanford for FREE! I know right? This covers almost all topics to get well versed in the subject

**Remember** You will need additional resources that you find while researching on your own after you are done with 100days obviously. 
<br>


### Schedule

We have the materials now and let's look over at the schedule.
The schedule is being provided for beginners the ones who are already feeling confident on the topics do not go easy on yourself. A little revision would not hurt. **100days** 🔥
<br>

|   Day/Days | Hours                              |
| ---------- | -----------                        |
|  22        |   2 hours (Stats-1)                |
| 23-25      | 7 hours At your own pace (Stats-2) |

<br>

# Day 26 to 35  -  PANDAS and NUMPY

If you are thinking as to "Why on earth would anyone spend next 10 days learning a two libraries?"... Then yes! About a year back, we would be on the same page..But I've realized the importance of these libraries over the course of months and how much we need it to get started with the basic analysis of data. 

Now if you have done some course on python and covered a little bit of pandas then it's great! <br>
But if you are a beginner then we have got you covered too! 😉 

- [Numpy Official Tutorial](https://numpy.org/numpy-tutorials/) - Several Hours (self paced) <br>
In the quest of learning things from sources like Youtube we often forget that almost all libraries are made with the purpose of easing the whole process and they are open source! Which means most of the times they have their own tutorials covering the whole topic from scratch. Here's a tutorial covering concepts needed for getting started with data analysis from the makers of Numpy.<br>
**Note:** When you open the next page rather thank clicking on the links provided straightaway, I would recommend reading everything and once you reach the end of the page they have a link to the next module. (Image below)<br>
![numpy_tut](/numpy_tut.png)

- [Numpy for beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUT1VHiLmmI) - 1 hour<br>
This is absolutely great for people who are getting started. Freecodecamps's course are to point and easy to understand and this should get you started.

- [Pandas Official Tutorial](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/intro_tutorials/index.html) - - Several Hours (self paced) <br> 
Pandas is an important library when it comes to analysis data with the help of python for data science. Mastering pandas and its features is very important. 

- [Pandas 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmEHCJofslg)- 1 Hour<br>
This video is a complete package but I do recommend using the official tutorial first then using this video as a refresher.

<br>

**These videos and links will hardly take 3-4 hours to complete so why 10 Days...? The thing with python libraries in general is that, one needs to  practice by themselves without the help of any tutorials. Below you will find list of exercises in python to get started with handling data in python.**

- [Pandas with Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas) - 4 Hours <br>
One of the best thing about Kaggle courses is that they make sure whatever they share is focused on data science. So you don't need to worry about drifting away from the topic.<br>




|   Day/Days | Hours                              |
| ---------- | --------------                     |
|  26-27     |   Numpy Official Tutorial          |
|  28        |   Numpy for beginners              |
|  29-31     |   Pandas Official Tutorial         |
|  32        |   Pandas 1                         |
|  32-35     |   Pandas with Kaggle               |

<br>
<br>

# Day 36  TAKE A BREAK 😎 🙌🏼

<br>
**If you feel 10 days is not enough for practising..Do not worry! Next 10 days all you'll be doing is practising Data Cleaning and Feature engineering with the help of what ever you have learned so far. This will surely help you a lot. But there's still a thing missing .... VISUALIZATIONS.... Thats's right. Sometimes a simple viz tells us a lot about the data and we definitely need it while data cleaning and feature engineering.**

<br>
<br>

# Day 37 to 45 - Data Visualizations 

There are abundant viz libraries out there, but to dive in the world of viz, starting with "matplotlib" and "seaborn" is a must. 

- [Data Viz with Matplotlib, Seaborn and Pandas(Bonus)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPVsHOlRBBI&t=19560s)- 2 Hours<br>
This is another great video from freecodecamp and it starts from the middle of an 9 Hour long video, where we focus only on plotting with pandas and data viz with matplot and seaborn. 

- [Data Viz with Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/data-visualization) - 4 Hours<br>
Now is the time to put the things you learned to the test. Exercises should get your concepts clear. What are you waiting for? Let's get started! 
<br>

- Research a little on your own.. Now this "do it by your own" you would not find much of it here but there are so so many exercises online for free ... Try it, Play with Datasets, Explore a little. Visualize! 

<br>


# Day 45 to 55 - Feature Engineering and Data Cleaning 

Features found in data play a crucial role and directly influence the predictive models and the results that we need. 

Here are the link for a article that should help you understand the importance. [Click here](https://machinelearningmastery.com/discover-feature-engineering-how-to-engineer-features-and-how-to-get-good-at-it/)<br>

- [Feature Engineering Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/feature-engineering) - 6 to 8 Hours

- [Data Cleaning Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/data-cleaning) - 4 to 6 hours 

- [Feature Engineering by Krish Naik](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZoTAELRMXVPwYGE2PXD3x0bfKnR0cJjN)- 12-14 hours

<br>


|   Day/Days | Hours                              |
| ---------- | --------------                     |
|  37-40     |   Kaggle- Feature Engineering      |
|  41-43     |   Data Cleaning Kaggle             |
|  44-55     |   Feature Engineering Youtube      |


<br>


# Day 45 to 59 - Machine Learning

Now for machine learning there are "TONS" of courses of there.. Literally! But after my experience with it and doing tons of courses (both paid and unpaid), Here's a few I found that turned out to be even better than the paid ones. 


- [Machine learning CrashCourse by Google](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course) - 15 Hours<br>
This course is one of the best ones out there for the ones learning by themselves. It has practice questions, real world problems and viz's. Lectures from Google's researcher. 
This is not just machine learning it also covers ->
   - Problem Framing - 1 Hour
   - Data Prep       - 1.5 Hours
   - Clustering      - 4 Hours
   - Recommendation  - 4 Hours
   - Testing and debug - 4 Hours


- [Intermediate Machine learning with Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intermediate-machine-learning) - 4 Hours<br>
If you haven't completed the google's course yet, I recommend that you complete that course first then jump onto Kaggle's Course. 


- [Scikit-Learn Course - ML with python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqNCD_5r0IU) - 2 Hours<br>
 



Now folks, do remember that we are doing this in 20 days. Now mastering this in 20 days is obviously not possible. But these two courses alone should help you understand the very basics of machine learning from scratch and especially Google's course to understand the real world applications and dive into the world of API's because data science is not just done in jyputer notebooks. 
**The best resource out there for free is Freecodecamp.org's course on machine learning which is like a specialization of whopping 300 Hours.** Dedicating 2 hours everyday..? Thats 150 days alone for machine learning. 

<br>


|   Day/Days | Hours                              |
| ---------- | --------------                     |
|  45-52     |   ML CrashCourse by Google         |
|  53        |   Problem Framing and Data Prep    |
|  54-55     |   Clustering                       |
|  56-57     |   Recommendation Systems           |
|  58-59     |   Testing and Debug                |
|  60-62     |   Kaggle ML                        |
|  63-64     |   Scikit-Learn Course - ML         |

<br>

### Day 65  Take a break or use the day to complete pending topics, if any. 


# Day 66 to 70 - Machine Learning Challenges 

Spending good 5 days to solve machine learning challenges is a great way to start. I would recommend starting with Kaggle's Titanic dataset. There are so many great notebooks using various algorithms. I would even recommend glancing thru the my own notebook on the dataset featuring all almost all machine learning algorithms and their comparison. 

- [Titanic Overview - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
- [My notebook- All algorithms](https://www.kaggle.com/utkarshxy/titanic-all-algorithms-comparison#Finally!-Models.....)

| ---------- | --------------                     |
|  66-68     |   Titanic ✅                        | 
|  68-70     |   Various Problems                 |

<br>

# Day 71 to 80 - Complete Deep Learning 

Last few days.... No time to waste. Let's get right to it. 
### Also if you have reached this far....First of all congrats for reaching till day 70. If you've been following the only rule that was there our team will now start looking at your daily updates for what you have done. There's a suprise at the end. Wait for it.😉

# Day 81 to 100 - Deployment and Understanding Pipelines

Now that you understand almost everything and why do we need models and you can predict stuff. But always remember Data-Science is more than just jyputer notebooks.... And deploying your models where you solve a real world problem is a skillset which is very much in demand and now also a necessity. 

Before diving into deployment let's talk a little about data pipelines. Here's an [article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/whats-data-science-pipeline/) from geeksforgeeks that neatly explains the whole concept. 

Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9IGkBfOoic) that also talks about how to create pipelines using Sklearn. Yes! There are multiple ways of creating pipelines. 

If this 👆🏼 does not get anything in your head then I have a few more videos...WE got you covered! This video by CodingEntrepreneurs is a classic for understanding pipe;ones with the help of jyputer, pandas and FastAPI.

Now what are api's... especially in the field of data science? [Here](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/11/an-introduction-to-apis-application-programming-interfaces-5-apis-a-data-scientist-must-know/).

Once you are done with all those. Let's get back at deployment and look at some resources that can help us with deployment. Do remember, there are multiple deployment platforms and the process is not that different, its almost identical except for a few changes in steps here and there depending on the platform of choice. 

- [End to end Ml model deployment - Car prices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_tpQSY1aTs&t=11s) - 1.5 Hours 
This is again a great video by Krish. Its' clean, simple and beginner friendly. 

- [Ml deployment in Google Cloud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw6NMQrYc6w&t=3816s)
This might be a little difficult to understand by being familiar with cloud services and deployment of either google, amazon or microsoft is always a plus. 

**Other ways of deployment ->**

- [Deploy Machine Learning Model using Flask](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_tpQSY1aTs&t=11s)

Flash itself can be used to deploy models using products like Heroku and Docker. There are plenty of resources out there. Our main focus was to get you familiar with Deployments, API's and Pipelines.
