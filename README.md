# Day 1 - Installing the Tools

Now this there isn't a fixed ide that you can gets your hand dirty with. But the best two are - 
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) 
- [Vs Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

Keep in mind that here we are taking the more "Traditional" approach of learning Data Science with **Python**, if you feel like working with R, that is amazing go ahead and download [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com).

Also... for windows users here is the [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKVRkB0fot0) to get you started with the installation.


That's it for DaY 1! Prep yourselves we will be starting from tmr... by then I would suggest you all to go thru few tutorials and get familiar with the environment. Anaconda is a full data science package and unlike VS Code you do not have to install anything else. VS Code on the other hand takes very little efforts to setup and a little time to get used to, but once done it works like a charm and I use it as a one stop for all coding projects and building websites. Below is the link that should help you setup
"Extensions" for VS Code.

# Day 2 to 10  - Programming for DS (Basic)

If you are already well versed in python. I would still suggest you to complete [this](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python) course which is free and will help you warmup for the journey ahead. 

Now, If you have no clue about python and how to get started well no worries, there are plenty of resources online and I'll  set you on the right path. Let's get started.

1. Python Basics - Start from 0 - [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2k9Jh3jDVU&list=PLWKjhJtqVAbkmRvnFmOd4KhDdlK1oIq23) - 2 Hours <br> 
 Now if none of these links help you and you still do not understand.... do not worry! We still got you covered. Here's this amazing video for everyone starting right from 0.


2. Python for Data Science - [LINK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHBE6Q9XlzI) - 12 Hours<br>
 Freecodecamp's one of the best free resources and here we leverage their amazing 12 hour video for absolute beginners to get started with their journey. 

3. Python Basics with Kaggle - [LINK](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python) - 4 Hours.<br>
This link is from Kaggle. If you know any other languages like C / C++ / Java then python should'nt be hard to get started with. The above link will take almost 4 hours to get complete even if you are a beginner in python. 

For the ones who have are well versed in python, I would suggest you take only python with Kaggle that should refresh everything.

### Schedule

Given that there is no fixed way that one might use the above links let's sort the schedule part for you. We have 8 days in total. (It was supposed to be 7 but we value your precious **sunday** ðŸ˜‰).


**For Beginners** (Using All 3 links)

So we have a lot to work with... yeah? Here...we are planning to utilize 2 hours from your precious 24 for python. 

|   Day/Days      | Hours  |
| -----------| ----------- |
|  1         |   2 hours (start form 0)   |
| 2 to 6 | 2 hours each day (freecodecamp)      |
| 7 - 8  |  2 hours each for Kaggle

# Day 11 to 21  - SQL for DataScience
Hi! Pretty sure you are now a "pythonista" now let's tackle this SQL. 
Unlike many other pathways out there, SQL is usually placed at the last to cover and being a student myself I am pretty sure if SQL is done in the last days.... Nobody would want to do it.
Why should we tackle it AND **Why 10 days for SQL?** and get it done with? 
- It's easy.
- It's Super easy
- It's a must if you want a to be a Data Scientist

Now SQL is very important when it comes to handling data and with analysis. Below are the links that you will surely help and set you on the path to master SQL

- [SQL from the start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXV3zeQKqGY) - 4 hours <br>
Beginners... This is right where you should start.
- [Querying and managing data](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql#sql-basics)<br>
This is Khan Academy's finest. There are practice tests... Go and ace it!
- [SQL Tutorial for Data Analysis](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/introduction-to-sql/)<br> **Note**: This is the most important of the lot, as we have just 100 Days, we need to know what a particular topic is and what it is used for in a certain area. Here, we are focusing on **SQL for Data Science**. This link has 3 subparts (basic, intermediate, advanced). Check the image below.

### Schedule

We have the materials now and let's look over at the schedule.
The schedule is being provided for beginners the ones who are already feeling confident on the topics do not go easy on yourself. A little revision would not hurt. **100days** ðŸ”¥

**For Beginners** (Using All 3 links)


|   Day/Days      | Hours  |
| -----------| ----------- |
|  1-2        |   2 hours each (Sql From start)   |
| 3-8 | 2 hours each (SQL Tutorial for Data Analysis)      |
| 9-10 (Optional) |  Querying and managing data |

Now the last is optional if you are able to complete the rest in time.
